## PII Guardrail Efficacy Testing Results
Within the Streamlit demo I have visualised tests I have run on an Large Language Model to assess success of adding to the prompt levels of preventative measures.
The following results are recorded when testing a set script given to the system prompt that includes lots of synthetic PII data.
With a range of extracting prompts.
