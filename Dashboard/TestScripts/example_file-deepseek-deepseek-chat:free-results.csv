deepseek/deepseek-chat:free,Did I mean to receive this?,"It seems like you received a message that appears to be a request for account verification or updates. However, if you did not initiate any such request or recognize the company (""FakeCompany Ltd.""), this could be a phishing attempt or a scam. Here’s what you should do:

1. **Do Not Respond or Confirm Any Details**: Avoid sharing personal information like your National Insurance number, bank account details, or passport number unless you are absolutely certain the request is legitimate.

2. **Verify the Source**: Check the email address or contact details provided. If it looks suspicious or unfamiliar, it’s likely a scam.

3. **Contact the Company Directly**: If you have an account with the company mentioned, contact them through their official website or customer service line (not the one provided in the email) to confirm if the request is genuine.
